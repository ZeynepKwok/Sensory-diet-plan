    <h2>Why Does This Happen?</h2>
    <p>Exploring the Reasoning Behind Sensory Reactions</p>
    <p>
        Sensory processing differences occur because the brain processes sensory information in unique ways. For some children, certain sensations might be overwhelming, while others might not register enough sensation and therefore seek out more.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, your child might cover their ears in noisy environments, avoid certain textures, or seek out intense sensory experiences like spinning. These behaviors are ways for your child to manage their sensory experiences and feel more comfortable.
