    <h2>What Is Happening to My Child?</h2>
    <p>Understanding Autism and Sensory Sensitivities</p>
    <p>
        Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition that affects how a child communicates, interacts with others, and experiences the world. Every child with ASD is unique, with their own strengths and challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        One common aspect of ASD is <strong>sensory sensitivity</strong>. This means your child might be overly sensitive (hypersensitive) or under-sensitive (hyposensitive) to certain sensory inputs like sound, touch, taste, or movement. These sensitivities can lead to strong reactions or behaviors that might seem unusual but are completely natural responses to how they perceive the world around them.
