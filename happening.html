        <h2 id="title">What Is Happening to My Child?</h2>
        <p id="understanding">Understanding Autism and Sensory Sensitivities</p>
        <p id="description1">
            "Why does my child cover their ears in noisy places, or why do they seem to seek out spinning and jumping endlessly?" As a parent or guardian, you may notice that your child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) responds to the world in unique ways. ASD is a developmental condition that affects how a child communicates, interacts with others, and experiences the world. Every child with ASD is unique, with their own strengths and challenges.
        </p>
        <p id="description2">
            One common aspect of ASD is sensory processing disorder (SPD). This means your child might experience the world differently through their senses, like sound, touch, taste, or movement. These differences can show up in two main ways:
        </p>
        <h3 id="overSensitivityTitle">1. Over-Sensitivity (Over-sensitivity)</h3>
        <p id="overSensitivity">
            This is when your child’s senses might feel too strong or overwhelming. Imagine hearing a loud noise that makes you jump, or wearing itchy clothes that you can’t wait to take off. For a child with over-sensitivity, everyday experiences might feel like this all the time.
        </p>
        <h3 id="underSensitivityTitle">2. Under-Sensitivity (Under-sensitivity)</h3>
        <p id="underSensitivity">
            This is when your child’s senses might not feel strong enough. They might not notice things that others do, or they might seek out stronger sensory experiences to feel "just right."
        </p>
        <h3 id="examplesTitle">Examples of Sensory Sensitivities:</h3>
        <h4 id="hearingTitle">1. Hearing (Auditory)</h4>
        <p id="hearingOver">
            • Over-sensitivity: Your child might find certain sounds too loud or overwhelming, such as alarms, crowded places, or even everyday noises like a running faucet or a ticking clock. They might cover their ears, cry, or try to avoid noisy environments.
        </p>
        <p id="hearingUnder">
            • Under-sensitivity: Your child might not respond to their name being called or may seem unaware of background noises that others notice. They might enjoy making loud noises themselves or seek out noisy environments.
        </p>
        <h4 id="sightTitle">2. Sight (Visual)</h4>
        <p id="sightOver">
            • Over-sensitivity: Bright lights, fluorescent lighting, or busy patterns might be too much for your child. They might squint, cover their eyes, or prefer dimly lit rooms. They might avoid eye contact or find visually complex environments overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p id="sightUnder">
            • Under-sensitivity: Your child might not notice visual details that others do or may seek out visually stimulating activities like watching spinning objects or bright lights. They may enjoy watching things move quickly or may be drawn to bright, colorful objects.
        </p>
        <h4 id="touchTitle">3. Touch (Tactile)</h4>
        <p id="touchOver">
            • Over-sensitivity: Your child might find certain textures uncomfortable or even painful, such as scratchy clothes, sticky hands, or light touches. They might avoid messy play or physical contact.
        </p>
        <p id="touchUnder">
            • Under-sensitivity: Your child might seek out touch sensations, such as rubbing their hands on different textures, or they might not notice when their hands or face are dirty. They may enjoy or seek out rough play, like pushing, pulling, or crashing into things.
        </p>
        <h4 id="tasteTitle">4. Taste (Gustatory)</h4>
        <p id="tasteOver">
            • Over-sensitivity: Your child might be very picky about food, refusing to eat certain textures or strong flavors like spicy, sour, or bitter foods. They might gag or refuse to eat unfamiliar foods.
        </p>
        <p id="tasteUnder">
            • Under-sensitivity: Your child might chew on non-food objects like clothing, pencils, or toys to satisfy their need for oral sensory input. They may enjoy or seek out intense flavors, preferring very salty, spicy, or sour foods.
        </p>
        <h4 id="smellTitle">5. Smell (Olfactory)</h4>
        <p id="smellOver">
            • Over-sensitivity: Strong smells, like perfumes, cleaning products, or certain foods, might be overwhelming for your child. They might feel uncomfortable or even sick from certain odors.
        </p>
        <p id="smellUnder">
            • Under-sensitivity: Your child might not notice strong smells that others do or may seek out strong scents, enjoying sniffing objects or people.
        </p>
        <h4 id="movementTitle">6. Movement and Balance (Vestibular)</h4>
        <p id="movementOver">
            • Over-sensitivity: Your child might feel uncomfortable or scared during activities that involve movement, like swinging, jumping, or riding in a car. They might prefer to stay still and avoid activities where their feet leave the ground.
        </p>
        <p id="movementUnder">
            • Under-sensitivity: Your child might crave movement and constantly seek out activities like spinning, swinging, or jumping. They might seem to have endless energy and might find it difficult to sit still.
        </p>
        <h4 id="bodyTitle">7. Body Awareness (Proprioception)</h4>
        <p id="bodyOver">
            • Over-sensitivity: Your child might feel uncomfortable or disoriented by certain movements or positions, such as being lifted or moved suddenly. They might be overly aware of their body’s position, feeling uncomfortable in certain postures.
        </p>
        <p id="bodyUnder">
            • Under-sensitivity: Your child might not be aware of their own strength, bumping into things, or pressing too hard when writing or playing. They might seek out "heavy work" activities like pushing, pulling, or carrying heavy objects to help them feel their body better.
        </p>
        <h4 id="internalTitle">8. Internal Body Awareness (Interoception)</h4>
        <p id="internalOver">
            • Over-sensitivity: Your child might be overly aware of internal sensations like hunger, thirst, or the need to use the restroom, leading to anxiety or distress.
        </p>
        <p id="internalUnder">
            • Under-sensitivity: Your child might not recognize these internal cues, leading to challenges with recognizing hunger, full bladder, or pain, which can result in toileting accidents or difficulty reporting illness or injury.
        </p>
        <h4 id="temperatureTitle">9. Temperature Sensitivity (Thermoception)</h4>
        <p id="temperatureOver">
            • Over-sensitivity: Your child might feel too hot or too cold very easily, even in mild conditions. They might be very selective about clothing based on perceived temperature comfort.
        </p>
        <p id="temperatureUnder">
            • Under-sensitivity: Your child might not notice temperature extremes, leading to inadequate responses to cold or heat, such as not dressing appropriately for weather conditions.
        </p>
        <h4 id="painTitle">10. Pain Perception (Nociception)</h4>
        <p id="painOver">
            • Over-sensitivity: Small bumps or scrapes might feel very painful to your child, causing them to react strongly to minor injuries.
        </p>
        <p id="painUnder">
            • Under-sensitivity: Your child might not react to injuries or discomfort in expected ways, sometimes ignoring pain or not noticing when they are hurt.
        </p>
        <h3 id="whyTheseSensitivities">Why These Sensitivities Occur:</h3>
        <p id="whyTheseSensitivitiesDesc">
            These sensory sensitivities happen because your child’s brain processes sensory information differently. Imagine the volume being turned up too high or too low on a radio. For children with ASD, their "sensory volume" might be set too high, making everything feel too intense, or too low, making them crave more input.
