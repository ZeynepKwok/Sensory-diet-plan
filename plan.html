      <h2>What is Sensory Processing?</h2>
      <p>
        Sensory processing refers to the way the nervous system receives, organizes, and interprets sensory information. It is the mechanism by which we understand and respond to sensory input from our environment. The human body has several senses, each responsible for different types of sensory input.

      <h2>What is a Sensory Diet?</h2>
      <p>
        A sensory diet aims to use a mix of sensory activities that meet their sensory-processing challenges for regulating and reducing over-responsivity or under-responsivity by providing sensory input. Every child has different challenges, and as occupational therapists, we work with children and their families to tailor their responses.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand a childâ€™s sensory needs, imagine a time when you were at work, and you had a busy morning by lunch, you are tired and distracted. To help you get through the rest of your day, you might need a break to go for a walk, or have a cup of tea or listen to music. These activities are similar to sensory activities your child might need to reset and refocus.
