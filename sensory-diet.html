        <h2>What Is a Sensory Diet Plan? Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>Understanding and Implementing Sensory Diets</p>
        <p>
            A <strong>sensory diet plan</strong> is a personalized schedule of sensory activities that help your child regulate their sensory input throughout the day. These activities can help calm, alert, or balance sensory responses, depending on what your child needs at any given moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Why It Works:</strong> Sensory diet plans are effective because they are tailored to your childâ€™s unique sensory profile. Research and clinical evidence support the use of sensory activities to improve focus, reduce anxiety, and help children with ASD participate more fully in daily life.
