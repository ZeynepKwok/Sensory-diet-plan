      <h2>What is Sensory Processing?</h2>
      <p>
        Sensory processing refers to the way the nervous system receives, organizes, and interprets sensory information. It is the mechanism by which we understand and respond to sensory input from our environment. The human body has several senses, each responsible for different types of sensory input.

      <div class="category">
        <h3>Hearing (Auditory)</h3>
        <p>
          Over-sensitive: Some kids might find certain sounds too loud or overwhelming, like alarms or busy places. They might cover their ears or avoid noisy environments.<br>
          Under-sensitive: Other kids might not notice sounds easily or might enjoy making loud noises themselves, like shouting or listening to music loudly.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="category">
        <h3>Sight (Visual)</h3>
        <p>
          Over-sensitive: Bright lights or fast-moving things can be too much for some kids. They might avoid looking directly at lights or prefer dimly lit rooms.<br>
          Under-sensitive: Some kids might enjoy watching spinning objects or bright, colorful lights and seek them out.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="category">
        <h3>Taste (Gustatory)</h3>
        <p>
          Over-sensitive: Some kids are picky eaters and might not like certain food textures or strong flavors like spicy or sour foods.<br>
          Under-sensitive: Other kids might love very strong flavors and might chew on things that aren’t food.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="category">
        <h3>Smell (Olfactory)</h3>
        <p>
          Over-sensitive: Strong smells, like perfumes or certain foods, can be overwhelming for some kids, making them feel uncomfortable or even sick.<br>
          Under-sensitive: Some kids might not notice strong smells at all, or they might enjoy sniffing things like scented candles or lotions.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="category">
        <h3>Internal Body Awareness (Interoception)</h3>
        <p>
          Over-sensitive: Kids might be very aware of feelings like hunger or the need to use the bathroom, which could make them anxious.<br>
          Under-sensitive: Some kids might not realize when they’re hungry or need to go to the bathroom, leading to accidents or discomfort.

        <h3>Temperature Sensitivity (Thermoception)</h3>
        <p>

      <div class="category">
        <h3>Pain Sensitivity (Nociception)</h3>
        <p>
          Over-sensitive: Small bumps or scrapes might feel very painful to some kids, causing them to react strongly.<br>
          Under-sensitive: Other kids might not notice pain as much and could ignore injuries, which might lead to unnoticed problems.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="category">
        <h3>Oral Sensory (Mouth Sensitivity)</h3>
        <p>
          Over-sensitive: Some kids might not like certain textures in their mouth, like crunchy or mushy foods, and might avoid brushing their teeth.<br>
          Under-sensitive: Other kids might like chewing on things like their clothes, pencils, or toys to get extra oral stimulation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="category">
        <h3>Gravitational Insecurity (Movement/Vestibular)</h3>
        <p>
          Over-sensitive: Some kids might be afraid of activities where their feet leave the ground, like jumping, climbing, or swinging.<br>

          Under-sensitive: Other kids might not be aware of their own strength and might bump into things, press too hard when writing, or enjoy heavy work activities like pushing or pulling objects.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="category">
        <h3>Touch Sensitivity (Tactile)</h3>
        <p>
          Over-sensitive: Some kids might find certain textures uncomfortable or even painful, like scratchy clothes, sticky hands, or light touches. They might avoid messy play or dislike being touched.<br>
          Under-sensitive: Other kids might seek out touch sensations, such as rubbing their hands on different textures, or they might not notice when their hands or face are dirty.

      <h2>What is a Sensory Diet?</h2>
      <p>
        A sensory diet aims to use a mix of sensory activities that meet their sensory-processing challenges for regulating and reducing over-responsivity or under-responsivity by providing sensory input. Every child has different challenges, and as occupational therapists, we work with children and their families to tailor their responses. For example, children with sensory processing difficulties may struggle with everyday sensory input like sounds, textures, and movements that can either overwhelm or underwhelm them. A sensory diet helps them regulate their responses, making focusing, learning, and interacting with others easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand a child’s sensory needs, imagine a time when you were at work, and you had a busy morning by lunch, you are tired and distracted. To help you get through the rest of your day, you might need a break to go for a walk, or have a cup of tea or listen to music. These activities are similar to sensory activities your child might need to reset and refocus.
      </p>

    <div class="info-section">
      <h2>Does Your Child Have Sensory-Processing Challenges?</h2>
      <p>
        Sensory needs can manifest in different behaviors in children. They can sometimes look like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Playing rough</li>
        <li>Increased movement like jumping, spinning, swinging, rocking, fidgeting or crashing into things</li>
        <li>Prone to running into things or clumsiness</li>
        <li>Biting or chewing non-food items</li>
        <li>Refusing to wear certain clothing items because they are uncomfortable</li>
        <li>Refusing to eat certain foods</li>
        <li>Reacts strongly to loud noises like covering their ears when the blowdryer is on</li>
        <li>Licking hands</li>
        <li>Thinking the lights seem too bright</li>
        <li>Thinking the sounds seem too loud</li>
        <li>Thinking the soft touches feel too hard</li>
        <li>Experience food textures that make them gag</li>
        <li>Have poor balance or seem clumsy</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="info-section">
      <h2>What Are the Benefits of Using a Sensory Diet Plan?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provides necessary sensory input to help maintain attention during tasks.</li>
        <li>Reduces distraction.</li>
        <li>Decreases frequency and intensity of meltdowns and tantrums.</li>
        <li>Helps manage hyperactivity and impulsivity.</li>
        <li>Improves attention and focus.</li>
        <li>Promotes calmness and relaxation.</li>

      <h2>Instructions to Use Sensory Diet Plan Generator</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The table represents one day's worth of activities divided into times when your child may need sensory input.</li>
        <li>Every day, you will follow this schedule of activities to keep a consistent routine.</li>
        <li>Note your child’s mood before and after the activity. If they feel cranky and irritable while crashing into walls, even after the activity, it could mean it may not be enough to meet their needs and may need to be changed.</li>
        <li>Monitor the amount of time spent doing the activity. This helps ensure the need is met and also shows whether your child enjoys or is engaged in this activity.</li>
        <li>Use the notes section to add any additional comments or concerns about the activity or the child's response and behavior.</li>
        <li>Keep the schedule with pictures in a space where you and your child can easily see it, such as on your refrigerator, so that you can both incorporate it into your everyday routine.</li>
      </ul>
