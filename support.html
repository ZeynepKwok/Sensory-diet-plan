        <p>Steps to Support Your Child</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Seek Professional Help:</strong> The first and most important step is to consult with medical professionals, especially an <strong>occupational therapist (OT)</strong>. An OT can assess your child’s sensory needs and develop a personalized intervention plan that’s tailored specifically to them.

            <strong>Using This Tool:</strong> While you’re seeking or waiting for professional guidance, you can use our <strong>Sensory Diet Plan Generator</strong> to create a supportive plan for your child. This tool is designed to help manage your child’s sensory needs in the meantime and can complement the advice you receive from an OT.
